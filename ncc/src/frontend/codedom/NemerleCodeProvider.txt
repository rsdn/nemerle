* NemerleCodeProvider README

	It is an experimental implementation of CodeDomProvider for Nemerle
	(sadly to say, it is written in C#). The basics of the implementation
	comes from Mono's CSharpCodeProvider implementation.

	There are only three classes:
		- Nemerle.Contrib.NemerleCodeProvider
		- Nemerle.Contrib.NemerleCodeCompiler
		- Nemerle.Contrib.NemerleCodeGenerator

	NemerleCodeProvider implements ICodeProvider, except for
	GetConverter() which is not implemented at all.

	NemerleCodeCompiler tries to pick up compiler command line from
		1) environment variable "NCC_PROVIDER_COMMAND"
		2) application configuration section "ncc-provider-command"
	If neither of them were found, then it just expects "ncc" is runnable.

	NemerleCodeGenerator has explicit limitations (maybe much more;
	I don't know much detail about nemerle language):
		- It throws NotSupportedException at goto statements.
		- It throws NotSupportedException at labeled statements.
		- There are no differences between expression statements
		  and method return statements.
		- Fields and local variables are always mutable. None of
		  them are written as def (readonly).
		- Typed array creation is not supported. Types are ignored.
		- Many C#ism remains.
