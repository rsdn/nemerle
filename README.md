# What Is It

Nemerle is a high-level statically-typed programming language for the .NET platform. It offers functional, object-oriented and imperative features. It has a simple C#-like syntax and a powerful meta-programming system.

Features that come from the functional land are variants, pattern matching, type inference and parameter polymorphism (aka generics). The meta-programming system allows great compiler extensibility, embedding domain specific languages, partial evaluation and aspect-oriented programming.

# Quick sample

## Hello world

Create _hello.n_:
```nemerle

WriteLine("Hello world")
```
Compile and run
```bat
"C:\Program Files\Nemerle\ncc.exe" hello.n /out:hello.exe
hello.exe
```
Will output
```bat
Hello world
```
