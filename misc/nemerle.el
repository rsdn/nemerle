;;; Commentary:

;; A major mode for editing nemerle source files.  It provides syntax
;; hilighting, proper indentation, and many other features.
;; To install the nemerle mode, put the following lines into your
;; ~/.emacs file:

;; (setq load-path (cons "/path/to/dir/where/this/file/resides" load-path))
;; (autoload 'nemerle-mode "nemerle.el"
;;   "Major mode for editing nemerle programs." t)
;; (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.n$" . nemerle-mode) auto-mode-alist))

;; If you'd like to have every line indented right after new line put
;; these lines into your ~/.emacs files.

;; (defun my-nemerle-mode-hook ()
;;   (define-key nemerle-mode-map "\C-m" 'newline-and-indent))
;; (add-hook 'nemerle-mode-hook 'my-nemerle-mode-hook)

;; You may use variables nemerle-basic-offset and nemerle-match-case-offset
;; to customize indentation levels.

;; By default indentation based syntax is turned on. It is switched off
;; inside any parens anyway so it should be ok. If you think otherwise
;; you can use following in your ~/.emacs file:

;; (setq nemerle-indentation-based-syntax nil)



;;; Change Log:

;; 2006-12-27 Piotr Kalinowski <pitkali@gmail.com>
;;   * Added indent-expr-to-paren variable, so now the user can
;;     choose behaviour when breaking the expression inside
;;     parens.

;; 2006-03-06 Piotr Kalinowski <pitkali@gmail.com>
;;   * I have corrected if-else structures handling
;;     and in-match detection.
;;   * Added support for indentation based syntax
;;     - try .. catch and if .. else alignment
;;     - tab iterates over different indentation possibilities
;;     - backspace if pressed inside indentation deletes
;;       until previous indentation level
;;     - \C-c. to shift region right, \C-c, to shift left
;;     - \C-c\C-j to indent single line, use region-indent
;;       to indent multiple lines
;;     - inside any parens indentation based syntax
;;       modifications are turned off
;;     - support for explicit switching syntax type with
;;       \C-c\C-i and state feedback in mode line.

;; 2005-05-10 rzyjontko <rzyj@o2.pl>
;;   * final fixes of indentation engine and comment handling

;;     - adapted coloring scheme

;; 2004-04-27 rzyjontko <rzyj@o2.pl>
;;   * further coloring improvements
;;   * fixed syntax table

;; 2004-01-24 rzyjontko <rzyj@o2.pl>
;;   * fixed coloring

;; 2004-01-23 rzyjontko <rzyj@o2.pl>
;;   * indent to open parenthesis

;; 2003-10-09 rzyjontko <rzyj@o2.pl>
;;   * nemerle mode automatically sets file coding system to utf-8
;;   * syntax table changes
;;   * more colours
;;   * indentation framework

;; 2003-10-05 rzyjontko <rzyj@o2.pl>
;;   * initial version



;;; Known Bugs

;; There is a problem with single quote character, as it is also used 
;; in type variables and may not be treated just like in C.  There is
;; only one situation when you will suffer from this, namely if you try
;; to insert the following sequence: '"'.  In this case, everything after
;; the double quote will be coloured as a string.  However there exists
;; a very simple workaround for this: simply type '\"' instead.  The same
;; problem applies, when trying to indent line with '[' or '('.  Use the
;; same workaround i.e.: replace them with '\[' and '\(' respectively.


;;; Todo:

;; - further indentation improvements
;; - imenu (with ncc execution)
;; - make _ be a special symbol (write matcher functions)
