            Maps the given (zero based) source position to a (one based) line and column, by scanning the source character by character, counting

            on where it left off when this routine is called next. If the given position precedes the last given position, scanning restarts from the start.
            Optimal use of this method requires the client to sort calls in order of position.

            <summary>
            Maps the given (zero based) source position to a (one based) line and column, by scanning the source character by character, counting
            new lines until the given source position is reached. The source position and corresponding line+column are remembered and scanning carries
            on where it left off when this routine is called next. If the given position precedes the last given position, scanning restarts from the start.
            Optimal use of this method requires the client to sort calls in order of position.
